Greetings

I have no main project right now, as I have recently become a college student.

My side projects include, "The Magic Seas" (Novel), and "Heaven's Arena" (Game).

If any assets require scripting or animation attached to them, please contact me at mahboig@gmail.com with the relevant assets, or upload them first and send me a message.
